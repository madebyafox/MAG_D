```{r wip clustering multigrids}

## grids w/ same constructs, same ratings 
## constructs treated as unique rather than the same 
a <- bindConstructs(fbb2003, fbb2003)
cluster(a, along=1, align=FALSE)
## ^duplicates constructs


## grids w/ same constructs but different ratings 
a <- fbb2003
b <- permuteGrid(a,along=1)
supergrid <- bindConstructs(a,b)

## clustering w/ alignment shows how constructs treated as unique; some are reversed 
cluster(supergrid, along=1)

## clustering w/o alignment shows how constructs treated as unique; 
## despite the differing ratings, the structure is reflected??
cluster(supergrid, along=1, align=FALSE)


## NEXT STEP:: figure out what hclust() does (that's the underlying function)
## and how hclust() handles observation data 

## NEXT STEP :: see Bell (zotero)
##https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/10720530050130111?needAccess=true
## and fransella book (hardcopy) on multiple grids 

## NEXT STEP (lmer) :: email Mark Heckmann 
## see some example of how his lmer software was used 
## see if there are citations to the paper that demonstrate the model
## if not email him to ask about model structure 

## NEXT STEP :: explore EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS on the coded data
